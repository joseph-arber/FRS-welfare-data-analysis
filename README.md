# FRS-welfare-data-analysis
A descriptive and statistical data analysis of the UK welfare state system. 


  The aim of this analysis was to explore the main themes and trends behind the welfare payments system in the UK. However, given the size of the dataset, this specific projects timeframe and intended audience, the scope of the analysis was narrowed down to focus on a few key questions. Notably, the analysis carried out tried to gain a better understanding through two dimensions:
  
  - **1. Qualitative Understanding:** What are the main drivers of welfare claims, and what are the key reasons for failure to meet debt repayments?
  
  
  - **2. Quantitative Understanding:** Is housing benefit enough to sustain rent? 
  
  Specifically, this analysis wanted to invesigate what welfare and benefit features included in the dataset are most correlated with a users inability to manage debt repayments. Alongside this, the analysis also sought to determine whether the cost living, housing and rental costs matched the amount a user recieves in benefit payments such as Universal Credit, Housing Allowance and several others.
